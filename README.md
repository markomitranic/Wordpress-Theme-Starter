## The contents:

 * Gulp with sass setup from github.com/markomitranic

 * Useful SASS and JS snippets

## The Idea:

 * This was made for SAE Institute of Technology workshop
 * It is intented to help students learn the ways of WP theming
 * Learn using gulp and creating different settings for different environments
 * Learn basic ACF usage
 * Learn advanced ACF usage
 * Learn to create a custom page builder via ACF plugin
 * Also, it is indended to be used as a startup blank theme

## The future prospects

We definitely need to add internationalization of the theme, and the content to this workshop.
We need to do this asap:

## Advanced Custom Fields

I do not own any of the ACF code. This workshop relies heavily on ACF usage.

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) by Elliot Condon is the best WP plugin ever created. There is a free version available for students on the plugin homepage: https://www.advancedcustomfields.com

ACF Pro 5.3.2.2 embedded in the template is an incomplete and modified version used for student learning purposes ON STUDENT WORKSHOPS ONLY. The functionality of the plugin has been limited only to demonstrative purposes / topics covered within the workshops. The plugin cannot be updated.

ACF's licence DOES NOT allow for any usage (free or commercial) or sharing of the licence. Some of it's features are ommited in this version. Students who want to use ACF in any capacity can either download the free version from the link mentioned above or read more about licencing rules: https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/including-acf-in-a-plugin-theme/

ACF PRO developer licence is priced extremely fair, considering the work it does. After you have learned how to use it on this workshop, if plan on using ACF in professional capacity, i suggest buying a full version (25 AUD) or an unlimited developer licence (100 AUD) from the author. The full version has some of the best features ever and lifetime updates. Of course, free version is always available and completely usable.

Disclaimer: If a removal of this code is requested by Elliot, please contact me via GitHub, and i will do that promptly.

## Resources

I would like to say a big thank you:

* Elliot Condon, for creating ACF
* WP-Fill, for testing the limits of wp-wysiwyg
